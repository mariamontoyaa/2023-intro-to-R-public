# Introduction to Programming in R
This is a course for the Analysis and Policy and Economics M1 program at the Paris School of Economics.

The objective of this course is to provide you with the necessary bases in R programming to be able to carry out your empirical homework and research projects in the program. The course is structured in 4 classes of 2 hours. No preliminary knowledge of programming is required, but part of the content of the last lecture is based on what you're going to see in Econometrics I. Lectures will take place in the **computer room R2-07 at Campus Jourdan**. Feel free to bring your own laptop, especially if you're not used to the 🇫🇷🇧🇪AZERTY keyboard. 

## Before the first class:
- [ ] 💻 Install R and R Studio.
- [ ] 🐈‍⬛ Create a GitHub account
- [ ] 📥 Download the materials in the data folder (it can take a few days to set up your Wi-Fi access on campus) 

## Class policies:
- Respect your classmates and teacher. 
- There is no grade on this class, **BUT** I highly encourage you to take it seriously. If you pay your full attention in class and do the homework you will have a great foundation of programming skills. This will pay off when you do your Econometrics homework and (later on) if you work on applied research for your master's thesis or work as a research assistant.
- Homework should be turned in by 9 am. 🍬 Here is an incentive: if you hand in all your homework on time, independent of your performance on the assigned tasks, I will be available to answer any R questions throughout the academic year. You'll just need to add an issue here or send me an e-mail.
