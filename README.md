# Introduction to Programming in R
This is a course for the Analysis and Policy and Economics M1 program at the Paris School of Economics.

The objective of this course is to provide you with the necessary bases in R programming to be able to carry out your empirical homework and research projects in the program. The course is structured in 4 classes of 2 hours. No preliminary knowledge of programming is required, but part of the content of the last lecture is based on what you're going to see in Econometrics I. Lectures will take place in the **computer room R2-07 at Campus Jourdan**. Feel free to bring your own laptop, especially if you're not used to the 🇫🇷🇧🇪AZERTY keyboard. 

## Before the first class:
- [ ] 💻 Install R and R Studio.
- [ ] 🐈‍⬛ Create a GitHub account
- [ ] 📥 Download the materials in the data folder (it can take a few days to set up your Wi-Fi access on campus) 

## Do you have a question, you can't access the material or your code doesn't run?
Create a new issue and write down your question **publicly**: 
- Click `issues` at the top left of this page

- 📬 If you prefer to send me a message **privately**:
    - Email me at maria.montoya@psemail.eu
    - ⚠️ Don't forget to add `[intro-to-R]` at the beginning of the e-mail subject (otherwise it might get lost in my inbox)
    - 👁️ **I strongly encourage you to write your questions in public so everyone can learn. It is very likely that if you have this question or problem, other classmates also do.**
